My first repository
I'm Oluwapelumi, Pelumi for short, and I'm an aspiring web developer, with interests in creating world class EMR systems, useful in and integratable into any hospital across the world.
I also have interests in Aritificial Intelligence and the prospects it poses in the near future.
In time, I'll see about how these two can merge.
